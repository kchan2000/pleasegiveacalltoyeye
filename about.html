        <p>
            "Please Give a Call to Yeye" is an audio-based documentary that explores the intergenerational
            relationship between my paternal grandfather - Yeye - and me. Despite being closely involved in
            raising my brothers and I, we never seemed to understand them beyond their familiar and warm
            role as our grandparents. Decades ago, they faced the tumultuous socio-political and economic
            realities of a regime-changed China. They experienced the turbulent shocks of Chairman Mao
            and his party’s radical policies that disrupted and defined life for Chinese citizens in that era.
        </p>

        <p>
            Through a series of phone calls, my brothers and I embark on a journey to uncover and
            understand my grandfather’s complex relationship with China. In the difficult process, we find
            ourselves far more removed than initially expected.

        </p>

        <p>
            Through sensitivities fogged and obstructed by time, scrambles to find meaning lost in
            translation, and the dissection of countless visceral portraits of hardship, the piece struggles to
            sow two understandings together. To find common ground in space disconnected by forces
            beyond our grasp, to locate where seemingly parallel lines—intersect.
